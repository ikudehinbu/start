<p>Among all the books i read, <i><b>my favourite book is <u>Discover the real YOU</u></b></i>. This book was written by <acronym title="Bolts Andrew"> B.A</acronym> JOHN, a nigerian in 2001 and was published in 2002. <br>
  This book talks about <i>knowing who you really, standing for what you believe in, knowing your worth,having the right orientation, time management,priority setting, self esteem, dreaming and pursueing your dreams.</i> <br>
  This book is based on the <abbr title="Bolt Andrew John">writer's</abbr> true life story of how he struggled to be who he really was when he was in college in Nigeria. <abbr title="Discover the real YOU">It</abbr> talked on how the writer was able to lie in school to his friends because he had a very light colored skill and curly hair, that he is an American by birth and that is mother is also an american, making him an mix breed. A day came when the writer had to fill a form from school. <br>
  Details of the form are as follow:
  
  <form >
    Name: <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="yourname"> <br>
    Email: <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="your email"> <br>
    House address: <input type="text" name="House address" placeholder="your House address"> <br>
    Telphone no: <input type="tel" name:"telphone no" placeholder="your telphone number"> <br>

    Nationality: <br>
    
    <select name="nationality" multiple>
      <option value="Nigeria"> Nigerian </option>
      <option value="USA"> American </option>
      <option value="Ghana">Ghanian</option>
      <option value="spain"> Spanish</option>
      <option value="others"> others</option>
    </select> <br>
    
    Your Passport:
    <input type="file" name:" student passport"> student signature: <input type="text" name="student signature"> <br>
    Parent signature:
    <input type="file" name:" Parent passport"> Parent signature: <input type="text" name="parent signature"> <br>
    <pre>
      
      
      
      
    </pre>
 
  </form> <br>

<div>

  While the wirter was filling in the details of this form, he choose both <b><u><i> Nigeria</i></u></b> and <b><u><i> America </i></u></b> as his nationality because of the lies he had told his friends. When he got home to give his mother the form to put her passport and sign, he had forgotten to erase America as his nationality and his mother ask why he had choosen America and not only Nigeria. The writer confessed to his mother that, he had always lied to his friends that he was born in America and his mother asked him why? He told his mother that he wanted to be respected among his friends and that he was ashamed that they might make jest of him because of his skin color. <br>
  That day also, the writer told his mother of his inability to believe in himself, of how he keeps quite in class because he was scared of making mistakes and late he found out that ha actually need the right answer. The writer also told his mother, of the ideas in his mind and how he was scared of telling people about it because he felt it wasn't good enough. <br>
  During that conversation, the writer's mother found out his weakness and strength and helped him by giving him the orientation needed in order to turn his weakness into strength.
  Between the space of six months after that conversation with his mother, His orientation had changed, he had started implementing his ideas, he was able to discipline himself to achieve his goals both short and long term, he was also doing well in his school works, he wasnt shy to answer and ask questions in class even if others tried to oppose him and he received an award for the best overall student in his school . One other important parts was that <b><i> he was bold to tell his friends that he was a Nigerian apologized for lying to them.</i></b> <br> he was bold to tell his friends that he was a Nigerian apologized for lying to them.
  The writer was able to discover great potentials in himself because his orientation changed. Some of these words kept the writer going in successes 
<b><i><u><blockquote> "As long as there is determination, the word impossible does not exist" </blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Without pain there i no gain"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>" If you discover who you are, work on yourself, you will become a unique being that the world see a new version of you everyday."</blockquote> </u></i></b> <br>

  After i read this book, it helped me work on my fears, taught me discipline and time managmemt, how to sets goals and achieve them and many more. During the time of reading this book,i came across song titled <u><i><big>Fly</big></i></u> and a movie called <u><i> <big>3 idiots</big></i></u> and they were also of great benefits.
